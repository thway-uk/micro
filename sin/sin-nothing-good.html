  <h1>Sin — Nothing Good</h1>
  
      <p>
      "So now it is no longer I who do it, but <a href="../sin.html">sin</a> that dwells within me.
For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out.
For I do not do the good I want, but the evil <a href="../sin.html"><em>I do not want is what I keep on doing.</em></a>
Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.
So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand.
For <a href="../love.html">I delight in the law of God, in my inner being</a>,
but I see in <a href="../god.html"><em>my members another law waging war against the law of my mind</em></a> and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members." <small>— Romans 7:17-23</small>
