  <h1>The Names</h1>

<p>
The name of God is “I AM,”</br>
and the scrolls are strung with names,</br>
each a jewel of meaning,</br>
each a doorway to a state of being.
</p><p>
Genealogies are not dry dust,</br>
but rivers of identity—</br>
flowing from one consciousness to another,</br>
from “I AM” to “I AM” again.
</p><p>
Every name speaks a life,</br>
every life speaks a word,</br>
and every word is a whisper</br>
of who we may yet become.
</p>
<blockquote>
The name of the Lord is I AM; and the names of the generations are as steps of being, each declaring the stature to which a man may rise.
