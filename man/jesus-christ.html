  <h1>Jesus Christ</h1>

  <blockquote>
“This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” <small>— Matthew 3:17</small></blockquote>

<p>
Jesus, the Son of David, is <b><a href="../love.html">fulfilled love</a></b> . David, whose name means <em>beloved</em>, dreamed of building a temple — but it was his son who made it real. So too, Jesus is the wish come true: love as action. Healing, forgiving, lifting the lowly — He showed that love is not soft, but strong.</p><p>
If Jesus is love in form, how sweet it is to turn that love inward. To treat our own tender hearts with the same mercy He gave to others. To forgive our stumblings. To believe we are worthy. This is not vanity — it is the holy turning.
</p><p>
For the temple is now within. And the beloved Son still lives — not only in history, but in the quiet of our being.
