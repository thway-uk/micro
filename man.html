Man, Tender Image of “I AM”
</p><p>
Made not of dust, but of dreaming divine,
Man is awareness — God's tender design.
Not flesh alone, but heart and thought,
In image and likeness, inwardly wrought.
</p><p>
“I AM,” the whisper, sweet and adored,
Assumes the form by silent word.
The garden is mind, the soil is thought,
Where every seed of self is caught.
</p><p>
Dominion lies not in beasts or air,
But in the self one chooses to wear.
<a href="love.html">Adorable</a> power, most holy and grand —
To shape one’s world with heart and hand.
</p><p>
From Daniel’s fire to Solomon’s song,
The self you name is where you belong.
Put on the new, let the old man part —
Creation begins in the tender heart.
