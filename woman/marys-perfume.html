  <h1>Mary's Perfume</h1>

<p>
  
<a href="../woman.html"><em>She</em> </a>did not wait for tomb or stone,
but came while breath was still her own.
With tender hands and silent grace,
she touched His feet, not His face.
</p><p>
A vial broke — the room was filled
with <a href="../love.html">sweetness</a> none could bottle or build.
She spoke no word, but love was there,
in <a href="../love/ever-adore-thee.html">perfume rising through the air</a>.
</p><p>
Judas scolded, silver-eyed,
but love had nothing left to hide.
The cost was high — and gladly spent;
her heart, her oil, her worship went.
</p><p>
<em>The Song</em> had said: His name is poured,
like fragrant oil the soul adored.
And so she poured — and so He knew:
a crown of scent, before the dew.
</p><p>
Let others wait till death has come —
she crowned Him early, and was done.
And now her name, like perfume rare,
still lingers soft upon the air.

   — John 12
