  <h1>Sin</h1>
  
  <blockquote>
  "If you do well, shall you not be honoured? But if you do not, sin crouches at the door."<small> — Genesis 4:7</small>
   
  </blockquote>
      
<p>
Sin is not wickedness, but a gentle missing of the mark — a tender misalignment of the heart.
</p><p>
The Lord’s words to Cain are not wrathful, but lovingly corrective, as one might speak to an adorable yet erring child:

<blockquote>
So Cain was very <b>angry</b>, and his face fell.<small>— Genesis 4:5</small></blockquote>
</p><p>
Sin is a soft, weak thing — not a monster but a mood. A wayward assumption.
It waits quietly at the threshold, longing to be your master, yet you, dear soul, may rule over it.
</p>
      <p>
Cain is your outer self — confused, disheartened.
Abel is your inner offering — imaginal, unseen, yet <b>pleasing</b>.
And the Lord's <em>pleasure</em> lies always with the invisible lamb — the assumption of already being.
</p><p>
To assume lack is to crucify the wish.
But to do well — to feel the end with <a href="love.html">adorable</a> certainty — is to be honoured.
</p>

<blockquote>
and Abel also brought of the <em>firstborn</em> of his <em>flock</em> and of their fat portions. And the LORD was <em>pleased</em> with Abel and his offering, — <small>Genesis 4:4</small>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
Let not sadness become your sacrifice.
Let imagination bring the fat of the lamb.
</p><p>
Rule gently over what crouches.
Sin waits — but so does love.
