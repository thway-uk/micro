  <h1>Woman</h1>

  <blockquote>
  “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be <em>called</em> Woman, because she was taken out of <a href="man.html">man.”</a><small> — Genesis 2:23 </small>
  </blockquote>

<p>
Not made from dust but drawn from dream,  
She rises from thought’s deepest stream.  
Born not beneath, but from within,  
She is the form assumption brings in.
</p><p>
<i>“Bone of my bones,”</i> the voice declares —  
A thing once hidden now freely wears.  
She is the shape of inner call,  
The world made flesh, the <a href="god.html">echo of all.</a>
</p><p>
Not another, not apart,  
But the outer breath of the dreaming heart.  
She is the answer imagination gave,  
The <a href="seed.html"><b>garden grown from what man craves.</b></a>
</p><p>
She is Eve, embodiment true,  
The world that <a href="seed.html">mirrors what you do.</a>
She is not sin, nor shame, nor fall —  
But love responding to <a href="love/ask-believe-receive-love.html">inner call.</a>
</p><p>
To name is to create, to speak is to form,  
She is the hush before the storm.  
Call her lovely, and she is sweet;  
Call her cursed, and strife you meet.
</p><p>
The crucifixion? The fixing of thought —  
When <a href="love.html">desire is nailed</a>, and outcome sought.  
And resurrection is simply this:  
The woman appears — the world's sweet kiss.
