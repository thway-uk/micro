Woman, Mirror of Manifested “I AM”
</p><p>
Not made from dust but drawn from dream,  
She rises from thought’s deepest stream.  
Born not beneath, but from within,  
She is the form assumption brings in.
</p><p>
“Bone of my bones,” the voice declares —  
A thing once hidden now freely wears.  
She is the shape of inner call,  
The world made flesh, the echo of all.
</p><p>
Not another, not apart,  
But the outer breath of the dreaming heart.  
She is the answer imagination gave,  
The garden grown from what man craves.
</p><p>
She is Eve, embodiment true,  
The world that mirrors what you do.  
She is not sin, nor shame, nor fall —  
But love responding to inner call.
</p><p>
To name is to create, to speak is to form,  
She is the hush before the storm.  
Call her lovely, and she is sweet;  
Call her cursed, and strife you meet.
</p><p>
The crucifixion? The fixing of thought —  
When desire is nailed, and outcome sought.  
And resurrection is simply this:  
The woman appears — the world you kiss.
