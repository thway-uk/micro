  <h1>God</h1>
  
      <blockquote>
      In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.<small> — Genesis 1:1</small>
       </blockquote>
       
       <p>
THE Bible opens with a pictorial and symbolic description of imagination in motion. 
</p>
    <blockquote>
      And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.<small> — Genesis 1:3</small>
       </blockquote>
<p>This is the voice and the word of God.
</p><p> Elohim is a plural name revealing the manifold aspects within a single creative source—your own consciousness. The bible shows that this <em>“many within one”</em> reflects the diverse inner powers and assumptions working together in your imagination to shape your reality. You are the <a href="love.html">unified</a> source expressing through multiple inner faculties, creating by assumption. 
</p><p>These <a href="man.html">manifold</a> aspects of awareness are personified in scripture as <a href="man.html">men</a> and <a href="woman.html">woman</a>, <em>kings, judges and rulers.</em>
