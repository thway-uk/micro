  <h1>The Seed in Itself</i></h1>

  <blockquote>
  ““And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.” <small> — Genesis 1:11 </small>
  </blockquote>

<p>
Each little thing begins so small,
A tender seed, the cause of all.
It does not shout, it makes no sound —
But quietly brings the world around.
</p><p>
The seed is hidden, soft and meek,
Yet grows the life our hearts do seek.
What we believe with quiet grace
Will blossom in its rightful place.
</p><p>
The world is shaped by <a href="man.html"><em>what we hold
In secret thoughts</em></a>, both shy and bold.
No need to strive or look afar —
The seed is where the treasures are.
</p><p>
A fearful heart will plant with care
What brings about more grief or scare.
But happy thoughts, and love held dear,
Will grow a life both sweet and clear.
</p><p>

So tend your thoughts, your inner ground —
With gentle joy, and truth profound.
For every dream your heart has kissed
Begins with seed — and will exist.
