  <h1>Love</h1>
  
  <blockquote>
  Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall <em>cleave</em> unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.<small> — Genesis — 2:24 </small>
   
  </blockquote>
      
<p>
    Genesis 2:24 tells of love as inward joining.
To leave father and mother is to loosen the hold of old identity.
To cleave to the wife is to <b>crucify</b> oneself to the state longed for.
One flesh means the imagined has taken root — felt, accepted, and lived.
</p>

<blockquote>
  I AM that I AM, </br>
  bone of my bones, </br>
  flesh of my flesh!
   
  </blockquote>
      
<p>
<b>Love</b> in Scripture moves quietly.
It does not chase — it joins.
It binds awareness to desire with unwavering affection.
</p>

<blockquote>
And they shall be <i>one flesh</i>— the soul crucified to what it cherishes.
To <em>cleave</em> is the gentle power of becoming.
</blockquote>
