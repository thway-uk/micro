  <h1>Elohim: God</h1>
  <p>
Elohim is a plural name revealing the manifold aspects within a single creative source—your own consciousness. The bible shows that this <i>“many within one”</i> reflects the diverse inner powers and assumptions working together in your imagination to shape your reality. You are the unified source expressing through multiple inner faculties, creating by assumption.
