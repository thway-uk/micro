  <h1>Delight — Devotion — Fulfilment</h1>

  <p class="vintage-double-lines">
To <em><b>ask</b></em> is not to beg, but to <em>whisper</em> a wish with a heart made still and meek. It is the sweet stirring of a soul that <a href="../love.html"><em>dares to delight in possibility</em></a>. One does not ask from lack, but from love — with the innocence of a child reaching for something lovely because it simply belongs to them.
</p>
<p>
To <em><b>believe</b></em> is to hold that dear wish close, as one would cradle a promise in the dark.<blockquote><i>
My beloved is mine, </br
>and I am his</i> </br>

</blockquote> </p><p>It is a soft cleaving of the soul to the unseen, a mild and steady faith that says, <i>"Though I see it not, it is mine."</i> Belief is not loud; it is gentle, like a candle that will not be snuffed by doubt. It keeps its gaze inward and its heart tender.
</p><p class="vintage-double-lines">
To <em><b>receive</b></em> is not to strive or to earn, but to rest in the sweetness of already-having. It is the adorable quiet that falls when one knows the matter is settled. As the rose unfolds without effort, so does the fulfilled desire blossom from within, when love has done its work.
</p><p>
So the pattern is not mechanical, but sacred. Ask with joy. Believe with purity. Receive with peace. And let it all be wrapped in the mildness of a heart that knows: <em>Love never fails.</em>
